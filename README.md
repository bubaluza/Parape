# Parape
PARAPE is a device developed for Project Class at UEPG (Universidade Estadual de Ponta Grossa - State University of Ponta Grossa).
The class proposes the students to develop and solve a real client problem using commercial and industrial standards from the documentation to the implementation.
PARAPE covers physiotherapeutic monitoring of the action of walk, alarming the user by pulsing a motor when they did the movement incorrectly while the device is attached to their legs;

The client in use was a kid with celebral palsy that walked wrong when not giving attention. The objective was to alert the user so they could remember to walk in the right way.
